## About the project:
<p>
As a high school student learning programming using python for the first time , I wanted to apply what I have learned in the past 2 years into creating a project . For starters, making a notepad clone seemed weird at first but it was one of the easiest projects that I could lay my hands on . I used the Tkinter in Python for this project.It contains almost all the functions of notepad you would use minus a few of the things that I could not add to the project due to the limitations of the python module was using .  But it has been a great experience so far, having learnt how to convert a pyhton file to a executable and then bundeling it so that it can run on any computer .Hope you enjoy the project I made .
Also if there are any issues with the project please register the Issue so that I can improve the project . Thanks!
</p>

## How does it look?:
I have tried to make the PyPad look as similar to the Microsoft notepad as possible, but there were some limitations of Tkinter module . Hopefully in the future (If comeone would like to contribute)
it could be just like the notepad.
